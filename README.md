#  Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Analysis & Prediction ‚Äì India

##  Overview
This project analyzes and predicts **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across Indian states** using data analytics and machine learning.  
We explore sales trends over time, compare adoption rates between states, and identify the factors driving EV adoption.  

The project also includes **predictive modeling** to estimate future EV sales based on historical data.
