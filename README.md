#  Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Analysis & Prediction ‚Äì India

##  Overview
This project analyzes and predicts **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across Indian states** using data analytics and machine learning.  
We explore sales trends over time, compare adoption rates between states, and identify the factors driving EV adoption.  

The project also includes **predictive modeling** to estimate future EV sales based on historical data.

##  Machine Learning Model
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Target Variable**: EV Sales Quantity
- **Performance Metric**: RMSE  
- **Result**: RMSE ‚âà **130.58** ‚Üí On average, predictions differ by about 131 EV units.



##  Key Insights
- EV adoption in India is **growing rapidly**, especially in recent years.
- Certain states lead adoption due to better infrastructure and policies.
- Passenger EVs (especially 2-wheelers) dominate the market.
- There are **seasonal spikes** in sales.
- Features like **State**, **Vehicle Category**, and **Year** are most important for predictions.



##  Business Recommendations
- **Policy Makers**: Focus on improving EV infrastructure in low-adoption states.
- **Manufacturers**: Target high-performing states and plan production to match seasonal peaks.
- **Investors**: EV market shows strong growth potential; consider long-term investment.
